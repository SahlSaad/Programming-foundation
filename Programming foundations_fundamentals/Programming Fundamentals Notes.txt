-Programming : the process of converting ideas into intructions that computer can understand & execute.

-machine language : like 01010111000
-high end language : human understand to interact with computer.
-we use Interpeter to read the human language (source code) into machine language (machine code) , there's 3 ways of doing this :
1- compile it, 2- interpret it, 3-combination of both.
1- c,c++     , 2-PHP,JS       , 3-java,c#,python.
-IDE = integrated development environments like VScode,Xcode.

-bug : something unexpected happens.
-crash : program stops early or freezes.
Error categories : 
1-Syntax : language rules broken,
2-Runtime : unable to execute,
3-Semantic : unexpected output.
Website for errors lookup : stackoverflow.

-Variable : container of values. words = string example:name = "Adam" 
-Rules for variable names in python :
1-can contain letter,numbers & underscores
2-can't contain spaces or starting with numbers.
3-can't be keywords like: break,and.
4-are case sensetive.
-Numbers = int or float example: age = 36, type() = to know type.
-Float = any number with decimal value like: 2.456
-Comments : used to describe your code.

-Conditional expresion = bolean : yes or no, working with 2 operands.
ex: 5 == 7 returns: False,  5 != 3 returns: True.
-Relational operators : >=<

-if-else Statements: 
if condition:
    do work
else:
    do something else

-Function: Block of code packaged together with a name.

-C writen languages like: C++, java

-Java: Cross-platform, can be used in:
 Desktop apps, Android apps.

-C++: Garbage collection, can be used in: 
 Games & game engines.

-library: a grouping of variables&functions that someone else has written.
